h1. Graphite Server Stem

graphite-server is a simple Stem package to quickly fabricate an Ubuntu 10.04 system running the "Graphite":http://graphite.wikidot.com/ trending package.

h2. Configuration

To get going, you'll want to take a look at graphite-server/graphite-server.json.  In particular, you may want to tweak 'instance_type' to use a larger image (such as 'm1.large').  Also look at 'key_name', and change it to match your private/public key pair name on the EC2 control panel.

h2. Usage

To launch a Graphite server, first install the stem gem:

pre. gem install stem

Next, ensure that your AWS access keys are in place.  One simple method is to add the following to your .profile:

pre.. 
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key

p. Finally, run the following to get things going:

pre. stem launch graphite-server/graphite-server.json graphite-server/userdata.sh

Use the following to find the IP address of your new instance:

pre. stem list

Connect to that instance via SSH to manage it.  

To access the web interface, just connect to the instance IP via your web browser.
